                Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the process of importing information from a website into a
                spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer. It’s one of the most efficient ways to get data from
                the web, and in some cases to channel that data to another website. First of all, to get familiar with

                title bar. Before closing the &lt;head&gt; you should add “style” for your website. We will discuss the

                We have seen few HTML tags and their usage like heading tags &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, paragraph tag
                &lt;p&gt; and other tags. We used them so far in their simplest form, but most of the HTML tags can also
                have attributes, which are extra bits of information.
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's
                opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value. Attribute names and attribute
                values are case-insensitive. However, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase
                attributes/attribute values.
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements are:
            </div>

            <div class="list">
                <p><span class="label">id</span></p>
                <p><span class="label">title</span></p>
                <p><span class="label">class</span></p>
                <p><span class="label">style</span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML page. There
                are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an element:
            </div>

            <div class="list">
                <p><span class="value">If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to
                        identify just that element and its content.</span></p>
                <p><span class="value">If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), you
                        can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements that have the same name.</span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. The syntax for the title attribute is
                similar as explained for id attribute.
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class of
                element. You will learn more about the use of the class attribute when you will learn Cascading Style
                Sheet (CSS).The value of the attribute may also be a space-separated list of class names. The style
                attribute allows you to specify CSS rules within the element.

            <div class="sub-title">XPath</div>

            <div class="txt">
                XPaths have a very big spectrum of usage, but for us the interesting part is related to HTML. XPath <sup class="ref" src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath"></sup> <sup class="ref" src="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp"></sup> can
                be used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML <sup class="ref" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML"></sup> (HTML is a type of XML) document. As we
                will later on see how elements are located with the help of CSS Selectors to give them styling, from
                that point we will have two powerful locating techniques.
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                XPaths are similar to the paths that we have in urls or in our operating systems, so it’s a sequence of
                elements which give direction to our desired element. Now go to a random webpage open Inspect->Elements
                point your mouse on a random element and press Right-Click->Copy->Copy full XPath. And paste somewhere
                to see that path. You will see that it starts with a html tag followed by body or head and so on till it
                reaches to the element you chose. There you can see the “Copy XPath” option also, the difference is that
                the full starts from the main tag while the regular locates a unique element without going so down in
                the HTML hierarchy. You might have noticed that the full path starts with double slashed “//” while the
                regular one with one slash “/”, here is the difference. Let’s look at some notations:
            </div>
