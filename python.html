                Python <sup class="ref" src="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/"></sup> <sup class="ref" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm"></sup> <sup class="ref" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&vl=en"></sup> is one of the most popular programming languages available out there, which is widely used for
                data science, analysis, manipulation, web development and system scripting . With the help of a
                programming language such as this we can store access and edit data, and make logical and mathematical
                operations send requests and get content of a website. We can open and edit files in our Operating
                System. “Python” is available for any type of Operating System, for example there is no difference you use
                Windows or Mac. Python is the perfect programming language for people without any coding experience.
                Moreover, python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. That is, if you are excellent in
                English, you have a big chance To get comfortable with python. Also Python has syntax that allows
                developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python is an ideal
                programming language for the financial industry. For the first step to get familiar with Python we will
                introduce Python variables and their types.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-title">Variables</div>

            <div class="txt">
                Variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no
                command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
                Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values.Therefore, by assigning different
                data types to variables, you can store “integers”, “decimals” or “characters” in these variables. The operand
                to the left of the “=” operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of it 
                is the value stored in the variable. Comments starts with a “#”.
            </div>

            <pre><code class="language-py">name = 'Armen'      # a string
age = 35            # an integer
salary = 100.000    # A float
</code></pre>

            <div class="txt">
                The “print” function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device. The
                message can be a “string”, or any other “object”. What we will write inside the parentheses is called
                “argument” or “parameter”.
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have
                been set. “String” variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes.
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                A variable can have a short name (like “x” or “y”) or a more descriptive name (“age”, “carname”, “total_volume”).
                Rules for Python variables:
            </div>

            <div class="list">
                <p><span class="label">must start with a letter or the underscore character</span></p>
                <p><span class="label">cannot start with a number</span></p>
                <p><span class="label">can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _
                        )</span></p>
                <p><span class="label">variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different
                        variables)</span></p>
            </div>


            <div class="txt">
                Python allows us to assign values to multiple variables in one line. On the other hand, we can assign
                the same value to multiple variables in one line.
            </div>

            <div class="sub-title">Operators</div>

            <div class="txt">
                The second most important part of learning Python is using Python “operators”. Operators are used to
                perform operations on variables and values. The simplest type of operators are Python “arithmetic operators”.

            <div class="txt">
                Python has five standard data types:
            </div>

            <div class="list">
                <p><span class="value">Numbers</span></p>

            <div class="txt">
                You can get the data type of any “object” by using the “type()” function.There are three numeric types in
                Python: “int”, “float”, “complex”. Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them. “int”, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length. “float”,
                or floating point number is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals. As we
                have mentioned above, we can convert from one type to another. For doing so, we need to use “int()”,
                “float()”, and “complex()” methods.
            </div>

            <pre><code class="language-py">a = 5    # int

                String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
                Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the
                string.
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                “List” is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. In Python lists are
                written with square brackets.

                There are certain things you can do with all sequence types. These operations include “indexing”, “slicing”,
                “adding”, “multiplying”, and “checking for membership”. In addition, Python has “built-in functions” for finding
                the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest elements.

                colon “:”, the items are separated by commas “,”, and the whole thing is enclosed in “curly braces”. An empty
                “dictionary” without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: “{}”.To access “dictionary”
                elements, you can use the familiar square brackets along with the key to obtain its value.

                These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in “if statements” and “loops”. Python “if”
                Statement is used for “decision-making” operations. It contains a body of code which runs only when the
                condition given in the “if” statement is “True”. If the condition is “False”, then the optional “else” statement
                runs which contains some code for the else condition. When you want to justify one condition while the
                other condition is not true, then you use “if statement”.

            <pre><code class="language-py">a = 55
b = 33

if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("b is not greater than a")
</code></pre>

            <div class="txt">
                The “else” condition is usually used when you have to judge one statement on the basis of another. If
                one condition goes wrong, then there should be another condition that should justify the statement or
                logic.

                In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first,
                followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code
                several number of times. Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more
                complicated execution paths.

            <div class="txt">
                A “loop” statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Python has two
                types of loop: the “while” loop and the “for” loop. A “while” loop statement in Python programming language
                repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is “True”. A “for” loop is used for
                iterating over a sequence, for example let’s print numbers from 1 to 10:
            </div>

            <pre><code class="language-py">for i in range(10):
    print(i)</code></pre>

            <div class="txt">
                The “range” function generates a sequence of integers starting from 0 up to 9 excluding 10.
            </div>

            <div class="txt">
                Or we print the elements of the dictionary “person” created earlier:
            </div>

            <pre><code class="language-py">for key in person:
    print(person[key])</code></pre>


            <div class="txt">
                In this example the iteration is done over the “keys” of the “dictionary”, thus we can access the value of
                the dictionary by the “key” variable which changes at each iteration. Python’s second operator for
                looping is “while”, which checks if a given condition is correct at the beginning of each iteration, for
                example:
            </div>


            <pre><code class="language-py">i = 1
                
while i < 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
</code></pre>
