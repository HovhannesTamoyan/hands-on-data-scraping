                We are happy to present you a “cookbook” for Data Scraping, which will help you understand the basics of
                the web, how it works and how to get the information you want from it. We will cover all the languages
                and tools required for getting started in the world of Data Scraping.

                We will start by covering the basic structure of web pages, we will learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then
                we will learn Python, this programming language provides a lot of pragmatic tools and packages for
                working with data, two of which are Scrapy and Selenium, which we will cover later on.
